# Currency converter React app

A simple currency-converting app. It lets the user choose from 161 major currencies and input an amount to convert. Automatically output exchange amount of chosen currency. Both output currency and input currency can be manipulated.

The app has been developed using React and styled with CSS. It fetches API data with every currency change is fully responsive for all device sizes.

Use of React useState and useEffect hooks, JavaScript loops and async/await functions has been exercised.

The project has been set up with Vite and deployed with Vercel.

Things to update:
* round converted amount to two decimal places
* display the conversion rate for given pair of currencies?
